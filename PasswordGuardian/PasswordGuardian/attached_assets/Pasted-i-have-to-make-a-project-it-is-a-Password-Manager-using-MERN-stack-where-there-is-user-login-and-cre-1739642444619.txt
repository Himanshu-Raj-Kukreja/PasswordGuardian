i have to make a project
it is a Password Manager using MERN stack where there is user login and creation and then there is CRUD operations and the data is stored and user is created and the user is able to store and organi usernmae password under website or link or name of the document or place or thing and it should randomly generate password each time for the user as soon as user click create it should be asked for what password for what a link a website a thing a object a app or anything basically a text for what the password is and then the user will enter username and the password should be randommly generated each time a new entry is made and password should meet the standard like  8 digit minimum and contain special letter alphabet numbers and one capital letter and as soom as user enter username for the each entry then it as soon as user goes to password it should as generate password menu in which user will select generate password one opion and second option generate passcode and as each time a password or passcode is randomly generated first it should be checked that it should not match with the exising generated password or passcode of existing entry and there should be sign in sign up page and user creation login and also store password and all using hashing
it should be working project and solving problem and it can showcase mern stack skills
as soon as user makes entry and entery password for what and then username then it should ask user first that weather he will enter password or generate random password also if randomly generated is selected the accordinglt you should ask that weather generate password or passcode and of password is selected the a password minimum 8 digit containing atleast one special character  one alphabet and one numeric atleast and atleast one capital letter should be generated and before giving password to user it should be crosschecked weather the password generated is not match with password stored in the user and if it matches then it should generate another password until it is unique same for passcode first give field to enter number of digits for passcode and according to user entered unmber the number of digits of passcode should be generated and it should also be matched with existing password and replaced if it already there and there should be a dashboard option in home when going in dashboard it should show number of password stored number of password same and number of password unique and it should check all the password weather ir is uer entered or generated then it should show and if password ids same then it should show that number of repeated password and also numbe rof weak password and number of strong passwrd based on the passwor and complexity and standard  of password and it should be working 
the password should be stores using hasting
